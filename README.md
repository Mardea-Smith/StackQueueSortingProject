# StackQueueSortingProject
It is an interactive console menu that allows the user to choose and execute functions for stack, queue, and sorting algorithms.

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

### Compilation
To compile the program, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where `main.cpp` is located, and run the following command:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o StackQueueSorting
After running a successful compilation, you can run the program with the following command:
./StackQueueSorting

Interactive Menu
The program presents the following main menu to the user:
--- Main Menu ---
1. Stack Operations
2. Queue Operations
3. Sort a List
4. Exit

Stack Operations
The stack operations include:
Push: Add an element to the stack.
Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
Peek: View the top element without removing it.
Check if Full: Verify if the stack is full.
Check if Empty: Verify if the stack is empty.
Count Elements: Get the number of elements in the stack.
Change Element Value: Modify an element's value at a specific position.
Display Elements: Show all elements in the stack.

Queue Operations
The queue operations include:
Enqueue: Add an element to the queue.
Dequeue: Remove the front element from the queue.
Peek: View the front element without removing it.
Check if Full: Verify if the queue is full.
Check if Empty: Verify if the queue is empty.
Count Elements: Get the number of elements in the queue.
Change Element Value: Modify an element's value at a specific position.
Display Elements: Show all elements in the queue.

Sort a List
This option allows the user to input a list of integers and sort them using the selection sort algorithm.
